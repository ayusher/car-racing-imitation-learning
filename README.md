# Car Racing Using Imitation Learning

This lean repository has all the tools necessary to train and evaluate a car-racing Tensorflow model from scratch. In fact, it only takes 5 episodes (<5 minutes) to generate enough data for the model to play competently!

Note: the gameplay shown above is after training the model on 5 episodes. It can perform much better with more training data! Also, it's pixelated such that you see what the model sees as it plays (96 x 96).
